                                                                          automation readme file
## Overview
This Selenium automation script performs the following tasks on the Kloudship QA environment:
1. Logs into the application.
2. Adds a package with a random dimension.
3. Deletes the added package.
4. Logs out and closes the browser.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before running the script:
- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (Ensure compatibility with your Chrome version)
- Required Python packages:
  ```sh
  pip install selenium
  ```

## Configuration
- **URL**: `https://ecspro-qa.kloudship.com`
- **Credentials**:
  - Username: `kloudship.qa.automation@mailinator.com`
  - Password: `Password1`

## Script Breakdown
### 1. **Login Function**
Logs into the application using the provided credentials.

### 2. **Add Package Function**
- Navigates to the "Package Types" section.
- Adds a package with a random dimension.
- Logs out.

### 3. **Delete Package Function**
- Navigates to the "Package Types" section.
- Finds and deletes the package added previously.
- Logs out.

### 4. **Execution**
- The script first adds a package, retrieves its name, and then deletes the same package.
- Finally, it closes the browser.

## Running the Script
Run the script using the command:
```sh
python script.py
```
Ensure that the `chromedriver` is in your system's PATH or specify its location in the script.

## Notes
- The script uses explicit `time.sleep()` calls for waiting, which can be replaced with WebDriver waits for better performance.
- Modify the package name logic if dynamic naming conventions are required.
- Ensure network connectivity and proper credentials before execution.

  ## Instructions

### Step 1: Open SQL Practice Tool
1. Open the **Google Chrome** browser.
2. Go to [SQL Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/).
3. Click on **SQL Database** on the left-hand side.
4. Click on **View Schema** to understand the relationships between `patients`, `doctors`, and `admissions` tables.

### Step 2: Execute Preliminary Update Queries
Before running the **SELECT** queries, execute the following **UPDATE** statements to modify the `admissions` table:

```sql
UPDATE Admissions SET attending_doctor_id = 29 WHERE attending_doctor_id = 3;
UPDATE Admissions SET patient_id = 4 WHERE patient_id = 35;
```

### Step 3: Execute SQL Test Queries

Now, solve the following SQL problems **without using specific clauses for `attending_doctor_id` or `patient_id`** (e.g., `attending_doctor_id != 1`, `patient_id = 2`, etc.).

#### Query 1: Select details of Doctors who have Admissions
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d.*
FROM Doctors d
JOIN Admissions a ON d.doctor_id = a.attending_doctor_id;
```

#### Query 2: Select details of Doctors who have no Admissions
```sql
SELECT d.*
FROM Doctors d
LEFT JOIN Admissions a ON d.doctor_id = a.attending_doctor_id
WHERE a.attending_doctor_id IS NULL;
```

#### Query 3: Select details of Patients whose Admission canâ€™t be completed due to missing doctor details
```sql
SELECT p.*
FROM Patients p
JOIN Admissions a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
LEFT JOIN Doctors d ON a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id
WHERE d.doctor_id IS NULL;
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the **UPDATE** queries are executed before running the **SELECT** queries.
- Avoid hardcoding specific values like `attending_doctor_id=3` or `patient_id=4` in the **SELECT** queries.
- Use **JOINs** and **NULL checks** to get the required results dynamically.

Happy Querying!
